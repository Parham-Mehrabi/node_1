we add new header after login called x-auth-token and expect our user to show their token like that in their next request to authenticate themselves

in /whoami end-point we are using req.user and req.is_authenticated that we add to request object in our authentication middleware,
this is simple how we can make our endpoints login_required or something like that


in our /login_required we are using another middle ware were we drop unauthorized users
you can easily create read_only middle wares like Django where you check the req.method and then drop some users

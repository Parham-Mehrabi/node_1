in index.js we create loggers and declare their levels, we can also use default log-level and modify it like this:

const winston = require('winston')
winston.add(new winston.transports.Console({level:'info'}))
winston.level = 'silly'

then whenever we need to log we can just either say:
winston.log($logLevel, $message, $meta-data)
or
winston.$logLevel($message, $meta-data)


for meta data we can pass the whole error object or an object including that and something else like a timestamp


next we add winston-mongodb package
we can send our ErrorStack to it as metaData just as i did in middlewares/error.js
    winston.error(e.message, { metadata: { myErrorStack:  e, otherKeys: "otherValues" } })
name of metadata key is configured in index.js where we create a new winston transports for mongodb however its default is 'metadata' anyway

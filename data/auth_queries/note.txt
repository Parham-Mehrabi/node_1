here instead of creating a new student and add properties to it like:
    const newStudent = new AuthStudent()
    newStudent.email = req.body.email
    newStudent.password = req.body.password

we did it directly when creating the object like this:
    const newStudent = new AuthStudent({email:new_student.email, password: new_student.password})


BUT later we used 'lodash' package to avoid do it manually so now we just say:

    const newStudent = new AuthStudent( _.pick(new_student, ['email', 'password']))

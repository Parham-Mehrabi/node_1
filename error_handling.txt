at first we use try/catch to send the proper message to user and log the Error for ourself,
but if every try to change the message or change the logging system, we should modify all the routes,
so we use another approach, we created a new middleware called error.js, and put it next to our last route,
then, instead of handling error in catch for each route, we call the next() and send the error to this middleware

default id has 24 characters which means 12 bytes.

12 bytes:
    1-4 (first 4): timestamp
    5-7 (next 3): machine identifier
    8-9 (next 2): process identifier
    10-12 (last 3): counter


since the id itself has timestamp we don't need to specify something like created_at in our object, we can simple use it,
for example if we want to sort them according to their created date we can sort them by id,
and also we can extract it from id using :
const time = id.timestamp()     // check in ./example.js



-------------------------------------


you can also validate ID with ***mongoose.Types.ObjectId.isValid(id)***,
so you can handle errors properly

we can also validate the object id in our validation either using regex(as i used to do it in previous commits),
or using a package called joi-objectid, i updated validate_student_id.js in this commit.

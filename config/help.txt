first of all the name of this directory should always be config (not configs or configurations)

second, config modules have some priorities as follows:

1.the first place its look for the key is the 'custom-environment-variables.json' (only if the variable key has a value in env)

2. then its check the value of NODE_ENV and if its have some value it goes for the_value_of_nodeenv.json file where
    the name of the file is equal to the value of NODE_ENV

3.if it didnt find the key by now it will check default.json file and its the final place which means if it dont find a key here,
    it will give you an error

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# in all files values are equal to the actual values in .json file except for custom-environment-variables.json,
    in this one it equals to the value of the ENV variable with the given name

# if there is no key with that name in ENV or the value of the key be empty (e.g PATH='') then it doesnt count,
    which means it will check other steps




-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

in environment variables where you run the app, you can modify the value of app.get(env),
if you don't have NODE_ENV, then the default value of app.get(env) is "development"
